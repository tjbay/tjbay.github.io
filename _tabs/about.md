I'm T.J. Bay, a data scientist of the machine learning and data engineering type. I'm currently at Sojern as a data science engineer. I was formerly at Ask Media Group and Alpine Data doing some of the same stuff and also some different stuff. Before that I was an adjunct professor in astronomy and an experimental physicist. And before that I went to college in Chicago and grew up in Oklahoma. I live the East Bay and have been in the bay area for 20 years. In my free time I like to spend time with my family, cook and play video games.
